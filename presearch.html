    <h3>Krik Krak Project</h3>
    <h4>Ongoing</h4>
    <p>The “Krik-Krak” framework is a familiar format that is historically rooted in African oral story-telling tradition.  Dr. Rahill has found that the use of metaphors in Haitian proverbs and in our story telling tradition to be a useful paradigm for developing and implementing culturally relevant interventions with Haitian clients (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2011.65.2.133">10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2011.65.2.133</a>).    Developing the Krik Krak mental health for pregnant Haitian teens intervention is among the first of many steps in reducing the depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and gestures and post-traumatic stress disorders that these young women live with.</p>
    <p>Krik Krak project was funded by the Healthy Minds for Adolescent Mothers: Achieving Healthy Outcomes for the Family [Round 20] initiative of the Global Grand Challenges. <a href="https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/about">Click here to learn more about the Grand Challenges initiatives, projects, and grantees!</a>

  <h3>Access and utilization of services by immigrant South Asian female survivors of intimate partner violence: Implications for social work practice, policy and research</h3>
  <h4>March 2021</h4>
  <p>Dr. Subadra Panchanadeswaran, Professor in the Adelphi University School of Social Work, and a Senior Scientist with the Social Work Interdisciplinary Research Lab (SWIRL) at USF, and Dr. Manisha Joshi, Associate Professor in USF’S School of Social Work & Associate Director of SWIRL, received an Internal grant from Adelphi University ($4,800) to conduct a study titled – “Access and utilization of services by immigrant South Asian female survivors of intimate partner violence: Implications for social work practice, policy and research”. </p>
  <p>In this study, they are collaborating with the Hindu Family Support Services (HFSS), a non-profit in Tampa, FL to examine how South Asian immigrant women (n=30) subjectively define intimate partner violence (IPV), resist and respond to violence, and seek help from informal and formal sources of help. This study is also documenting women’s perceptions of the help they received and the gaps in service provision. Additionally, in this study they are exploring the perspectives of service providers (n=20) who provide support and services to immigrant women and highlight their perceived challenges to service provision especially to immigrant South Asian women survivors of IPV.</p> </section>

  <h3>First “Virtual Training on Domestic Violence” for Advocates Who Work with Survivors of Domestic Violence of South Asian Ethnicities in the Tampa Bay Area</h3>
  <h4>July 2020</h4>
  <p>Survivors of domestic violence of South Asian ethnicities face cultural and linguistic barriers that prevent them from seeking and accessing domestic violence services in the US. A recently founded non-profit organization, Hindu Family Support Services (HFSS), a faith-based organization in the Tampa Bay area, provides culturally and linguistically appropriate supportive and logistical services to survivors in addition to connecting survivors to local services as needed. The Social Work Interdisciplinary Lab (a collaboration between the USF School of Social Work and the USF College of Public Health’s Harrell Center for the Study of Family Violence), in partnership with Adelphi University School of Social Work have developed a partnership with HFSS to better understand the needs of the volunteer staff of the organization. Based on the expressed needs, the academic partners conducted the first two day “Virtual Training on Domestic Violence” (July 12-13) for volunteers/advocates affiliated with the HFSS. This first of its kind training in the Tampa Bay Area, was attended by 20 volunteers and advocates, some of whom were survivors themselves. The resource persons for the training were Dr. Abraham Salinas-Miranda (USF College of Public Health, Harrell Center) and Dr. Manisha Joshi from USF’s Social Work Interdisciplinary Lab and Dr. Subadra Panchanadeswaran from Adelphi University School of Social Work, and Ms. Bithi Roy, a Psychotherapist associated with The Child Center of New York.</p>
  <p>The training was focused on understanding IPV (Intimate Partner Violence), its prevalence, healthy relationships and the implications of IPV for the people of South Asian ethnicities. We also discussed various forms of IPV, Florida Law as it relates to Domestic Violence, and how to identify survivors and offer resources and support. The content was further enriched with the presentation of several case studies by Ms. Bithi Roy, a trained social worker with extensive experience in working with survivors.</p>
  <p>In the post-training evaluation survey, all the participants indicated that the training was extremely useful, and they could see themselves using the knowledge gained to inform their work with survivors. The training was conducted free of cost.</p>
  <p>All the resource persons have continued to work with HFSS and are volunteering their personal time to help HFSS build the capacity to address Domestic Violence in the South Asian community in the Tampa Bay Area. The three partner institutions (HFSS, USF, and Adelphi University School of Social Work) are currently planning a Town Hall to formally launch and introduce HFSS to the Tampa Bay community and other initiatives including research and community outreach.</p>
