  <h4>Associate Director</h4>
  <p>Dr. Manisha Joshi, Associate Professor of Social Work in the College of Behavioral and Community Sciences at University of South Florida (USF), has a Ph.D. in Social Welfare from the University of Pennsylvania, School of Social Policy & Practice, MS in Public Health from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and an MSW from the University of Delhi, India. She holds a joint appointment in the College of Public Health at USF.  The primary aim of her research is to advance knowledge about the health of women and marginalized populations around the globe. Her particular focus is on violence against women, a significant public health issue in the U.S. and in international settings such as Haiti and India.</p>
  <p>Dr. Joshi has played a leading role in a variety of maternal and child health projects in the U.S., Haiti, and India. In 2018, Drs. Joshi and Rahill (Multiple PIs) received the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Grand Challenges grant for their study titled Krik Krak: Mental Health for Pregnant Haitian Teens (<a href="https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/krik-krak-mental-health-pregnant-haitian-teens" style="word-break: break-all">https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/krik-krak-mental-health-pregnant-haitian-teens</a>). In 2016, Dr. Joshi (PI) and her team were awarded the prestigious India-US 21st Century Knowledge Initiative Award  2016-2019 (formerly known as Obama Singh grant) to establish a unique Indigenous Studies Field School for Global Exchange in Northeast India in partnership with Rajiv Gandhi University (RGU) in Arunachal Pradesh, India, and RIWATCH, a community-based research organization in Arunachal Pradesh, India (<a href="http://www.usief.org.in/Institutional-Collaboration/2016Grant-Recipients.aspx" style="word-break: break-all">http://www.usief.org.in/Institutional-Collaboration/2016Grant-Recipients.aspx</a>; funded by United States Department of State and University Grants Commission, India). She also served as a co-investigator in an R24 grant (2013-2018) – SHARE Haiti: Syndemics HIV/AIDS Research and Education (<a href="http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R24HD077946-02" style="word-break: break-all">http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R24HD077946-02</a>) funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Joshi works with both qualitative and quantitative data and has published her work in several peer-reviewed journals including the <span class="italicized">American Journal of Public Health (AJPH)</span>, <span class="italicized">Psychology of Women Quarterly (PWQ)</span>, <span class="italicized">Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved (JHCPU)</span>, <span class="italicized">Journal of Affective Disorders (JAD)</span>, <span class="italicized">Social Work in Health Care (SWHC)</span>, and others.</p>
  <p>Dr. Joshi teaches a variety of undergraduate and graduate level courses including social work macro practice, research and statistics, introduction to social work, and has developed two successful study abroad programs (India and Spain) for the school of social work at USF. In 2019, given her many contributions to teaching and education, she received the USF Student Success/Academic Excellence Award and the USF Ambassadors Apple Polishing Award sponsored by the USF Alumni Association. In 2016, Dr. Joshi was honored with the USF system wide (i.e., across all USF campuses) Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award 2015-2016. In addition to teaching and research she has served as an appointed member of the Council on Global Learning and Practice of the Council on Social Work Education for 3 years (2016-2019). She is a member of the Society for Social Work Research, and the American Public Health Association and frequently presents at as well as volunteers for the different activities organized as part of their conferences (e.g., proposal/abstract reviewer). In addition, she has used her knowledge about strangulation as a form of violence to train domestic violence shelter workers, case workers, counselors, advocates, law enforcement officials, attorneys, legal interns and volunteers to improve response to victims and to improve evidence collection in domestic violence cases.</p>
